# Artificial Intelligence Projects

Welcome to my AI and Machine Learning repository! This collection features projects that explore various AI and ML techniques, ranging from Bayesian Networks to Neural Networks, with real-world applications in classification, detection, and optimization.

---

## **Overview**
This repository contains a mix of coursework assignments, personal projects, and experimental implementations. Two main projects to check out:
- **[Covid-Risk Bayesian Network](path-to-folder):** A probabilistic model for assessing risk during the pandemic.
- **[Sarcasm Detection Neural Network](path-to-folder):** A deep learning model for classifying text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
